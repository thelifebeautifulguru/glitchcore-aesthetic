Nevermore
A Peer-to-Peer System for Decentralized Finance and Commerce Applications

Nevermore is a distinctive blockchain initiative that has a particular focus on bolstering Distributed Finance and Commerce Applications. It represents a code fork of Ravencoin, a platform that has already advanced the underlying technology and principles of Bitcoin to accommodate assets. The development of Nevermore is driven by a dedicated team comprising both current and former Ravencoin developers, as well as hodlers and miners, who are collectively engaging in a parallel endeavor while employing a distinct set of trade-offs in pursuit of different objectives and strategies. In aiming to transcend the shortcomings of Ethereum's flawed security guarantees, Nevermore plans to augment Ravencoin's asset protocol even further, thereby enabling the functionality of Distributed Finance without the need for all-purpose smart contracts, while preserving the robust security standards associated with bitcoin.
